*TLDR; A fast-paced multiplayer RPG*

Grapple was made to compete in the [Kaboom game jam](https://replit.com/talk/announcements/KABOOM-JAM/127934).
We got 10th place :)
(no prize for that though).

## Grappling hook

Each player starts with a grappling hook. If any other player touches the grappling hook's line it will lower their health. 

## Loot

### Guns

Guns are scattered across the map. They are only spawned once per match. When you kill other players they will drop their loot. 

### Potions

Potions will also be scattered across the map.
They will serve as power-ups.

* 2x speed
* 25% health - restores 25% of your health
* 50% health - restores 50% of your health
* enigma crate - contains random loot

Grapple was made to compete in the [Kaboom game jam](https://replit.com/talk/announcements/KABOOM-JAM/127934).
It is fast paced and requires skill.
It's a shooter game, but not just another shooter game. We hope to be unique. It's planned to be a MMO shooting game. One thing that will seperate it from the rest is a grappling hook.
I know you're saying "A grappling hook! That's your big idea?"
The grappling hook is just one idea.
When we have time, we will add much, much more features.

## After the game jam

We hope to expand into a popular open-source project.
We want to continue improving.
We will add new, wild, gamemodes.
